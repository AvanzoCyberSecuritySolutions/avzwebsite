                Python is the backbone of modern software. It powers everything from cutting-edge AI to the microservices that run our daily lives. But with this incredible reach comes a hidden danger: a rapidly growing threat to the open-source supply chain.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2025, that threat is no longer theoretical. It's real, and it's happening every day. We're seeing a flood of malicious packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI), and they're infecting systems before anyone even notices. A perfect example of this was the Ultralytics YOLO package attack in December 2024, where attackers quietly compromised the widely-used computer vision library. The malicious version was downloaded thousands of times before the community caught on, a clear sign that our old security models are failing.
            </p>

            <p>
                This isn't an isolated incident. It's a new normal.

                <p>
                    Attackers are getting smarter. They're not just looking for vulnerabilities in the code itself, but in how we get that code. They are exploiting the trust we place in the open-source ecosystem with clever, dangerous tricks:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Typo-squatting:</strong> Publishing fake packages with names that are just a letter or two off from a popular library, like <code>requessts</code> instead of <code>requests</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repojacking:</strong> Taking over old, abandoned GitHub repositories that are still linked to trusted packages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slop-squatting:</strong> Registering package names that don't exist yet but are frequently "hallucinated" by AI code assistants, a new and emerging threat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    Once a developer runs a <code>pip install</code> for one of these packages, the damage is already done. Your system is compromised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem doesn't stop with rogue packages, either. Even the official Python container image can be a weak link. At the time of this writing, the standard Python base image ships with over 100 high and critical vulnerabilities. This creates the "my boss told me to fix Ubuntu" problem, where your development team inherits infrastructure security issues that are difficult and time-consuming to solve.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">It's Time to Change How We Approach Python Security</h2>
                <p>
                    The old way of doing things—just running <code>pip install</code> and moving on—is no longer viable. Developers, security engineers, and operations teams all need a new approach. You need real visibility and control over every single package you pull into your environment.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    The good news is that you don't have to overhaul your entire development process. You can secure your Python supply chain without disrupting your workflow. You just need the right tools and a clear, actionable plan.
