                The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a critical warning, adding three older D-Link router vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This action comes after credible reports of these flaws being actively exploited in the wild, posing a significant risk to affected networks.

                    The vulnerabilities, which date back to 2020 and 2022, impact several D-Link devices and have been assigned high-severity CVSS scores. Here's a breakdown of the flaws:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>CVE-2020-25078 (CVSS: 7.5):</strong> This flaw affects D-Link DCS-2530L and DCS-2670L devices and could allow an attacker to remotely disclose the administrator password. A December 2024 advisory from the FBI specifically warned that HiatusRAT campaigns were actively scanning for this vulnerability.</li>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2020-25079 (CVSS: 8.8):</strong> An authenticated command injection vulnerability in the cgi-bin/ddns_enc.cgi component of D-Link DCS-2530L and DCS-2670L devices. This could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands.</li>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2020-40799 (CVSS: 8.8):</strong> This critical flaw affects the D-Link DNR-322L and involves a "download of code without an integrity check" vulnerability. It could enable an authenticated attacker to execute operating system-level commands on the device.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                    It's crucial to note that while D-Link released patches for CVE-2020-25078 and CVE-2020-25079 in 2020, CVE-2020-40799 remains unpatched. The reason for this is that the affected DNR-322L model reached its end-of-life (EoL) status in November 2021. For anyone still using this device, the only recommended course of action is to discontinue its use and replace it immediately.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    CISA has mandated that all Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies take the necessary mitigation steps for these vulnerabilities by August 26, 2025. However, this is a wake-up call for all organizations and individual users. If you are using any of the affected D-Link devices, it is imperative to apply the latest firmware updates or, if necessary, replace the device to protect your network from these actively exploited threats.
