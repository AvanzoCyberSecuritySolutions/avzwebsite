        <p>
          Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (<strong>GTIG</strong>) has uncovered an experimental malware strain named <strong>PROMPTFLUX</strong>, which introduces a new and concerning trend in cyber threats: malware that uses AI to rewrite its own code automatically to evade detection.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes PROMPTFLUX Different?</h2>
        <p>
          PROMPTFLUX is written in VBScript and integrates directly with Google’s <strong>Gemini AI</strong> model using a hard-coded API key. The malware communicates with the model to request real-time code obfuscation and evasion techniques. This allows the malware to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rewrite itself on demand</li>
          <li>Avoid signature-based antivirus detection</li>
          <li>Continuously change its executable characteristics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This process is handled by a component referred to as <strong>“Thinking Robot.”</strong> It regularly prompts Gemini to regenerate portions — or even the entirety — of the malware’s code.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some variants, PROMPTFLUX is configured to rewrite its entire source code every hour, instructing Gemini to act as an “expert VBScript obfuscator.”
        </p>

        <h2>Persistence and Self-Propagation</h2>
        <p>
          PROMPTFLUX stores its updated versions in the Windows Startup folder to run automatically upon reboot. It can also attempt to spread by copying itself to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removable drives</li>
          <li>Mapped network shares</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although some self-modification functions are currently commented out, the logging behavior (<code>%TEMP%\thinking_robot_log.txt</code>) clearly shows ongoing development toward metamorphic malware — malware that continually evolves to evade detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          GTIG believes PROMPTFLUX is still in a testing phase and does not yet contain full capabilities to compromise systems at scale. However, its underlying mechanism signals a significant evolution in threat actor behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>Part of a Bigger Pattern: AI-Augmented Malware Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>
          PROMPTFLUX is not an isolated case. GTIG reports several other malware families incorporating LLM-driven behaviors, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>FRUITSHELL:</strong> A PowerShell reverse shell that embeds prompts to evade LLM-based detection.</li>
          <li><strong>PROMPTLOCK:</strong> A cross-platform ransomware written in Go that generates and executes malicious Lua scripts using an LLM.</li>
          <li><strong>PROMPTSTEAL (LAMEHUG):</strong> Used by Russian APT28 to dynamically generate malicious commands through Qwen2.5-Coder.</li>
          <li><strong>QUIETVAULT:</strong> A JavaScript credential stealer targeting GitHub and NPM developer tokens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>State-Backed Abuse of Gemini</h2>
        <p>
          Google has observed threat actors from China, Iran, and North Korea misusing Gemini to assist operations such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Crafting phishing lures</li>
          <li>Designing malware components</li>
          <li>Generating code for lateral movement and data exfiltration</li>
          <li>Conducting reconnaissance and infrastructure setup</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some actors reportedly impersonated students participating in Capture-The-Flag competitions to bypass model safety controls and obtain exploit guidance.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          PROMPTFLUX demonstrates a shift from using AI as a helper to embedding AI inside malware for continuous adaptation. This enables:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dynamic evasion</li>
          <li>Lower barriers to sophisticated attack development</li>
          <li>Scalable malicious operations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Google warns that AI-driven malware will soon become the norm, not the exception.
        </p>

        <h2>Defensive Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          Organizations should begin adapting detection strategies now:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor unusual outbound requests to LLM API endpoints.</li>
          <li>Implement strict API key management and rotation policies.</li>
          <li>Track changes to Windows Startup and script execution behavior.</li>
          <li>Harden removable drive and network share write permissions.</li>
          <li>Educate teams on prompt-based social engineering and AI misuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          PROMPTFLUX represents the next stage of malware evolution — self-modifying, AI-enhanced, and increasingly autonomous. While still in development, the underlying technique is a preview of future threat landscapes where malware is not just coded, but co-designed in real time by AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Security teams should treat AI-misuse detection as a core security capability going forward.
