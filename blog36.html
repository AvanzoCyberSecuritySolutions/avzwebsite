        <h2>Security Insight: Why Attack Surface Reduction Matters</h2>
        <p>
          The week’s events reinforce one key message: attack surface reduction (ASR) is more crucial than ever. In modern networks filled with unused domains, open ports, and orphaned accounts, attackers often exploit what’s already visible rather than discovering new vulnerabilities. Proactive asset management, regular exposure mapping, and smart defensive automation can dramatically cut risk without hindering operational agility.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The key takeaway from this week is clear: Cyber threats are evolving to appear ordinary — hidden in trusted applications, recruitment platforms, and legitimate tools. Defending against them requires more than antivirus or patching. It demands constant visibility, disciplined response, and forward-thinking defense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity is not a product or a single solution — it’s a continuous process. Every login, update, and patch plays a part in keeping systems secure.
