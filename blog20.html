                Commvault, a leading data protection and cyber resilience software company, recently disclosed several vulnerabilities that could be chained together for powerful remote code execution (RCE) attacks. This is a big deal because a compromised Commvault server can be a gateway to an entire network, exposing critical backups and data.

                <p>
                    Commvault is widely used by enterprises for managing backups and data across various environments, including on-premise, cloud, and hybrid setups. A successful attack on a Commvault system can lead to the following:

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Data Exfiltration:</strong> Attackers could steal sensitive data from your backups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Tampering:</strong> They could corrupt or manipulate backup data, making recovery impossible after an incident like a ransomware attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network-Wide Compromise:</strong> A foothold on the Commvault server could be used to move laterally within the network, gaining access to other critical systems like domain controllers and hypervisors.</li>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Vulnerabilities Explained</h2>
                <p>
                    Commvault has patched four specific vulnerabilities, discovered by watchTowr Labs researchers Sonny Macdonald and Piotr Bazydlo:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>CVE-2025-57788 (CVSS 6.9):</strong> An unauthorized API access flaw that lets attackers make API calls without credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2025-57789 (CVSS 5.3):</strong> A setup-phase vulnerability that allows remote attackers to gain admin control by exploiting default credentials. This is only a risk if the admin password hasn't been changed since installation.</li>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2025-57790 (CVSS 8.7):</strong> A path traversal vulnerability, which is the most severe of the four. It allows unauthorized file system access and can directly lead to remote code execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>CVE-2025-57791 (CVSS 6.9):</strong> An input validation flaw that allows attackers to inject or manipulate command-line arguments, which can result in a valid low-privilege user session.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    While each of these is a problem on its own, the real danger lies in how they can be combined.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Exploit Chains â›“</h2>
                <p>
                    Researchers found two main ways these vulnerabilities could be strung together to achieve pre-authenticated remote code execution, meaning an attacker doesn't need to log in first.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">Chain 1: The 'Input Validation' to 'RCE' Route</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li><strong>CVE-2025-57791</strong> is used to gain a low-privilege user session.</li>
                    <li>This is then combined with the most critical vulnerability, <strong>CVE-2025-57790</strong> (path traversal), to execute remote code.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">Chain 2: The 'Default Password' to 'RCE' Route</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li><strong>CVE-2025-57788</strong> (unauthorized API access) and <strong>CVE-2025-57789</strong> (default admin credentials) are used to gain administrative control.</li>
                    <li>This is then combined with <strong>CVE-2025-57790</strong> (path traversal) to achieve remote code execution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    This second chain is particularly concerning for organizations that haven't followed the best practice of changing default passwords after installation.

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What to Do Now</h2>
                <p>
                    Commvault has resolved these issues in versions <strong>11.32.102</strong> and <strong>11.36.60</strong>. The company's SaaS (cloud-hosted) solution is not affected.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Patch Immediately:</strong> If you are using an on-premise Commvault version before 11.36.60, you must update to a patched version immediately. This is the most crucial step.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review CISA's KEV Catalog:</strong> This isn't the first major vulnerability for Commvault. Earlier this year, another critical flaw (CVE-2025-34028) was added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, meaning it's being actively targeted by attackers. This underscores the importance of staying on top of Commvault's security updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Change Default Credentials:</strong> If you haven't already, change the default administrator password. This simple step can prevent the second exploit chain from being successful.</li>
                </ul>
