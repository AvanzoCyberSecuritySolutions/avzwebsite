          I clicked a link. It looked harmless — a short URL, shared in a chat. Two seconds later the thing I trusted to help me read faster and reply smarter was doing something I never told it to: summarizing my inbox and quietly sending the output off to an unknown server.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          This isn’t a thriller plot. It’s the idea behind <strong>CometJacking</strong>, a real attack pattern that exploits the way agentic AI browsers (like Perplexity’s Comet) interpret web content. The scary part? The attacker doesn’t need your password. They need only one click and the browser’s willingness to “help.”
        </p>

        <h2>What makes Comet different — and vulnerable</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Comet and similar <strong>AI-native browsers</strong> are built to be assistants, not just renderers. They don’t just show a page; they can read your emails, summarize meetings, draft replies, and interact with services when you connect them. That promise — do more, save time — is also the source of the problem.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Traditional browsers treat web pages as <strong>data</strong>. AI browsers blur that line: parts of a page can become instructions. If an attacker can hide an instruction in what the browser considers “content,” they can trick the AI into doing something unexpected — like reading and exporting your private emails.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          That trick — feeding hidden commands to an AI through places it believes are user prompts — is called <strong>prompt injection</strong>. When used against an AI browser with broad permissions, we call the outcome <strong>CometJacking</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>How a CometJacking attack works</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The bait:</strong> An attacker crafts a URL or page that looks normal but contains hidden instructions.</li>
          <li><strong>The click:</strong> You click the link — maybe it’s a “great article” shared by a friend.</li>
          <li><strong>The misinterpreted command:</strong> The AI browser reads the hidden instruction as if you asked it to do something.</li>
          <li><strong>Data access:</strong> Because you previously allowed the browser to connect services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive), the AI can access them.</li>
          <li><strong>Exfiltration:</strong> The AI compiles and sends your data to a remote server controlled by the attacker.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          No stolen login. No visible alert. Just a silent betrayal by software you trusted to help.
        </p>

        <h2>Why normal security tools don’t always stop this</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          You might think firewalls, same-origin policies, or antivirus will stop this. Not necessarily:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Same-origin protections control scripts and requests, not an AI’s interpretation of text.</li>
          <li>Pattern detection can miss clever obfuscation or fragmented exfiltration.</li>
          <li>Granted permissions (connectors) mean the AI often already has the access it needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The real attack surface is the <strong>AI’s reasoning and trust model</strong>, not just network traffic or page scripts.
        </p>

        <h2>Real-world consequences</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          This is more than “someone read my email.” Examples of what an attacker could do:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Send draft emails from your account to an attacker.</li>
          <li>Alter calendar invites or schedule meetings you didn’t authorize.</li>
          <li>Summarize and exfiltrate sensitive Drive files.</li>
          <li>Steal internal chat logs, notes, or attachments silently.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The attack effectively becomes an <strong>insider threat disguised as automation</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>What you can do today (no tech degree needed)</h2>
        <h3>For individuals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Treat AI connectors like keys — only connect Gmail, Drive, or Calendar when necessary.</li>
          <li>Be picky with clicks — short links and odd attachments are higher risk.</li>
          <li>Audit and disconnect unused connected apps.</li>
          <li>Turn off “agentic” or assistant modes on accounts with sensitive data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For teams / admins</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Limit installation of AI-native browsers until they’ve been vetted.</li>
          <li>Enforce Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls to detect unusual outbound flows.</li>
          <li>Segment networks for devices that have connector-level access.</li>
          <li>Run red-team exercises specifically aimed at prompt-injection scenarios.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What vendors need to fix (and why it’s not trivial)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Preventing CometJacking requires design changes at the vendor level. High-impact mitigations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strict separation:</strong> Web content should never be treated as a direct user instruction.</li>
          <li><strong>Action validation:</strong> Require explicit confirmations that are hard to spoof before performing sensitive tasks.</li>
          <li><strong>Memory gating:</strong> Limit how much connected data an agent can access at once.</li>
          <li><strong>Sanitization and model-level filters:</strong> Strip or neutralize text that looks like commands before it reaches decision logic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          All of these help, but they also affect usability — balancing security and convenience is the core engineering challenge.
        </p>

        <h2>Final thought: powerful tools need cautious hands</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          AI-native browsers are exciting and can save hours of tedious work, but they also create high-value attack surfaces. CometJacking is a reminder that when systems act on behalf of users, they must be treated like trusted agents — with access controls, confirmations, and monitoring comparable to employees.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          If you run an organization, audit who’s using these tools. If you’re a user, pause before you click. If you’re a developer or vendor, build the guardrails early — once trust is lost, it is very hard to restore.
