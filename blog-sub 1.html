      From the very beginning, it is worth understanding that almost all the principles that work in nature and the world around us also work in the world of deepweb. Our instincts are also absolutely evident here. Fears and desires drive us in our daily lives, and they also lead us through the web. in which we met.
    </p>
    What we want	<p>
It is quite simple to deal with desires. Almost all of us want money, power. success’s. confessions and of course lots and lots of great sex. These are all pretty natural desires. About some unnatural desires. which also create a lot of traffic in the Torah, I will probably keep silent. Let’s focus on the most understandable. Money
Almost all of us somehow ended up here once in search of easy or not so much money. Someone was lucky to be in the topic in the Golden time when no one knew about cybercrime. It was a time of opportunity and unbridled drive. As is always the case. when you’re in the first wave. But then the topic becomes more popular and in the second wave it becomes more difficult to earn money. Sharks from the first wave are not ready to share their part of the pie, jackals appear. ready to fuck for the sake of ten bucks, in short, it becomes difficult. However, it is worth noting that the world of high technologies is developing so rapidly. that almost every day there are new topics. Who would have thought of decentralized Finance and mining ten years ago? Who would have thought that video calls would become more popular than usual, and drug addicts would stop hanging out on opiates. and they will switch to synthetics. The world is really changing. And any changes lead to inefficiency. We certainly want to use these inefficiencies to make money.
Usually we want to get everything at once without much effort, I have some bad news for you. In any case, you will have to work. If you want to do everything right now, frustration is inevitable. Are you ready to read a five-hundred-page book if it contains a recipe for making money out of thin air? I think many people will be interested. What if the book has a thousand pages or two? Will you back off because it’s too long? Or yet the prospect of making money out of thin air makes you sweat reading such a book.
</p>
      If you don’t want to learn, life will teach you!<p>
What distinguishes the wise from the fools? Well, except that the coefficient of happiness and life satisfaction for fools is much higher ) Smart people learn from other people’s mistakes – fools learn from their own. These seem to be obvious things. but remember. how many times have you thought to yourself because of another failure? What a jerk I am to fall for this! And here I have good news! You weren’t the first or last person to make a stupid mistake. Many people will learn from this situation. and many will continue to Bang their heads against the wall.
A great way to avoid such mistakes and such lessons is to learn from other people’s mistakes without breaking your head in blood every time. Some people have already lost time and money in deep. Many were successful, some went to jail. All possible variations have already been passed by someone. And you have a choice – to go this way yourself. getting bumps and losing important resources along the way, or spend a little time and effort to learn from the experience of others.
</p>
         The choice will always be yours!<p>
Stubbornness and perseverance are not the same thing. You make your own choices. Be led to the tinsel that lies on the surface or drop deeper and find something really worthwhile. This has always been the case, the lazy and short-sighted will always be expendable. And only those who can make enough effort for the right time will find what they are looking for and get high in full!
I know that there are spoils of fate, those who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth. But I think. if you’re flipping through my notes. I don’t think you’re so far gone. You are looking for the right path, you have already started reading something other than advertising banners. There’s not much left…

      <p><b>Someone peed into their brains, that’s why they marked our blog as a scam.</b></p><br>
      <p>
        Just have a look at the “scam list”. See how big it is? It makes me think that they simply parced 
        all the links from a catalogue like <a href="#">Hidden Links</a> 
         and marked all of them as a scam. Easy. They give no proofs, no evidences, no explanations – nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It reminds me of a <a href="#">“TOR Scam List”</a> when they marked all the shop as a scam and then blackmailed
         the owners asking for money. I bet “Darkweb Magazine” 
        does the same. Any link owners reading this post got blackmailed? Please send me a message or leave a comment.

    <p>
      I’m not trying to say that their “scam list” is fake, there are scam services in there indeed, 
      but I want to pay my readers’ attention to the thing that all claims must be proved with the evidences. 
      Just have a look at this <a href="#">guy</a>, it is an old blog about TOR scams but he provides proofs for
       EACH service 
      he reviews. Or our author <a href="#">zerb</a>, he writes reviews of the services with proofs, 
      but even when he doesn’t have them, he doesn’t mark a service a scam without proofs.
    </p>
    <p class="position-relative">
      <span class="custom-shadow1 position-absolute rounded-pill"></span>
      I also noticed one interesting thing. On “Darkwep Magazine” they don’t have any commenters saying they were 
      scammed. When we publish similar post about any service, 
      there are many reviews left right away. I guess there will be many comment under this post either.
    </p>
    <p>Next thing, they sell a “trusted vendor list” for $250. My guess is that this “Darkweb Magazine”
       is run by the shop owners listed in that list or they pay a reasonable commission. This is just a guess, 
      I don’t have proofs. Yet. But it reminds me of a “Choose Better” business model (see it’s review <a href="#">here</a>).</p>
